          In this moment, surrounded by floating hearts that dance around us, 
          I want you to know how much you mean to me. Each heart that appears 
          represents a memory we've shared, a laugh we've enjoyed, a moment 
          of pure joy.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Click on the hearts as they appear - watch them burst into sparkles 
          of love, just like how you make my heart burst with happiness every 
          single day.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          You are my sunshine, my moonlight, and everything beautiful in between. 
          This little interactive love note is just a tiny representation of the 
          endless love I have for you.
